When using <code>csv.DictWriter</code>, as below, our dataset needs to consist of a list of dictionaries, where every dictionary has the same keys. A list of this keys constitutes the <code>fieldnames</code> argument of the <code>writeheader()</code> method, which we call to create the header row.\nIn the example below, we save a Python list called <code>bkst_data_csv</code> to a CSV file called <code>bookstore-data.csv</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>with open('bookstore-data.csv', 'w') as f:\n    fieldnames = bkst_data_csv[0].keys()\n    writer = DictWriter(f, fieldnames)\n    writer.writeheader()\n    for row in bkst_data_csv:\n        writer.writerow(row)\n</code></pre>\n\n</details>\n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<details>\n    <summary>Click for a Hint</summary>\n    <p>Two lists in Python, even if they contain nested elements, are considered equal only if they are <strong>exact duplicates</strong> of one another.
