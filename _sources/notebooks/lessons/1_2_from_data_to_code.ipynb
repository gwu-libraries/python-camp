    "2. Read the section below, `Introducing the dataset`, and as a team, record any questions you have about it.\n",
    "3. Run each cell of code in this notebook (by pressing `Control` + `Enter` on a PC,  `Command` + `Return` on a Mac). The output of running the code will appear below the cell.\n",
    "4. Each cell is accompanied by annotations, and in some cases, questions for discussion. Discuss your responses to these questions with your team. The note taker should brielfy document the conversation (including any further questions or points of confusion that arise).\n",
    "5. Blank cells labeled `Try it out!` invite you to write your own code based on the provided examples. Run your code and discuss the output with your team.\n",

    "### Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was obtained by scraping the [GW Bookstore](https://www.bkstr.com/georgewashingtonstore/shop/textbooks-and-course-materials) website. Because [web scraping](https://library.gwu.edu/events/web-scraping-what-you-need-know-2023-10-03) is a rather advanced topic, we won't be covering that process in Python Camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was also pre-processed to simplify it somewhat (removing extraneous and redundant elements, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in [JSON](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/python-camp/glossary.html#term-JSON) format. JSON (usually pronounced *jay-sawn*) is a common format for sharing data on the web. It's not as concise or human-readable as some formats (e.g., CSV, which is often used for sharing tabular data). But it has a few advantages that make it popular with programmers:\n",
    " - JSON data can be deeply nested, reflecting hierarchical relationships between data elements.\n",
    " - The JSON format comprises structures that map well onto the most common data structures used by modern programming languages. \n",
    " - The JSON syntax has a lot in common with languages like Python.\n",

    "1. We [import](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/python-camp/glossary.html#term-import) a Python module called `json`. A module is just some external Python code that provides a particular functionality. The `json` module allows us to convert data in JSON format to Python types. (More on types below).\n",
    "2. We use the `open` function to open a file in a directory called `data`. The file is called `bookstore-data-summer-2023.json`, where the `.json` extension indicates that this is a JSON-formatted file. (The file extension is part of the filename, like `docx` for Word documents or `.xlsx` for Excel spreadsheets.) \n",
    "3. The file is assigned to the temporary variable `f`.\n",
    "4. We use the `json.load` [method](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/python-camp/glossary.html#term-method) to read the file (`f`). This method is specifically designed for JSON files; it won't work if the file does not contain data in valid JSON format. \n",
