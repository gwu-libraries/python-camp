    "\n",
    "We can think about code as telling a story. A story about the intentions of those who wrote the code: \n",
    " - what they imagined users would do with their code,\n",
    " - and for what purpose,\n",
    " - and who they imagined those users would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, we often make this way of thinking explicit by developing **user stories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a user story expresses the _who_, _what_, and _why_ in a succinct but concrete way. Written at the outset of a project, user stories provide developers both with guidance as they plan the project, and with benchmarks for measuring the project's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here are a couple of user stories we could have written about the materials for Python Camp:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a beginning learner of Python (**who**), I want to write code in the context of explanations and examples (**what**), so that I can refer back to the material for review (**why**).\n",
    "2. As an instructor of Python Camp (**who**), I want to give learners self-paced exercises (**what**), so that I can focus on where individual learners get stuck (**why**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, developers create user stories with input from the people who will actually use their software. But even when that's not possible, user stories can offer a helpful framework for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the only user of your code might be you! But it's still good practice to document your intentions, and writing user stories can help you identify specific aspects or features of the code (developers call these _requirements_) that you need to target in order to meet your needs.\n"

Why? Because a Python dictionary is a data structure that can associate data with certain keys (like course identifiers).\n",
