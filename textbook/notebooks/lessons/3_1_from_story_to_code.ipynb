    "\n",
    "1. Walk through the first section, \"User Stories,\" and have each team do the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Share all the user stories in a shared doc, so that teams can choose from among them for the next exercise.\n",
    "   - Acknowledge that some user stories may be beyond the scope of what we can accomplish now, either because we haven't learned the relevant tools yet (e.g., making a website), or because our dataset doesn't support it (e.g., correlating textbook cost with course enrollment).\n",
    "   - Note that writing code is almost always an interative process. If we can't tackle the full scope of a user story at the moment, we can find identify a piece of it to work on, given our skills and resources.\n",

    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Have each team do the planning exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At this point, instructors should check in with each team to help them work through the above questions and/or address any questions the teams have flagged about implementation.\n",
    "   - If a team has chosen a more complex user story and/or an implementation that requires a Python feature or programming technique we haven't covered, consider one of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "      1. Steer the team toward a simpler version of what they're trying to accomplish, e.g., \"Python has great tools for data visualization, but we aren't learning about them in Python Camp. But instead of actually producing a graph or chart, try thinking through what the data would need to look like (in terms of structure) in order to produce such a chart. Can you write some code to transform the bookstore dataset into that structure?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. If the team seems up for it, _and if you feel comfortable supporting them_, you can introduce the feature or technique that the team needs to do what they propose. Examples at this stage might include things like\n",
    "         - creating a CSV file;\n",
    "         - using one or more string methods we haven't covered;\n",
    "         - sorting a list;\n",
    "         - looping over the items (key/value pairs) in a dictionary;\n",
    "         - etc.\n",
    "      3. Make sure to refer the team to documentation about the feature in the official Python docs and/or elsewhere.\n",

    "### Implementation\n",

    "Possible solutions to the two provided user stories can be found at the end of the instructor notebook. It's likely that some teams will need a lot of help with this part. Try to have them break the problem into conceptual parts and focus on each part. For instance, for the first user story, the development might proceed as follows:\n",
    "  - What elements do we need from the data in order to compute these summary stats?\n",
    "  - How can we iterate over the dataset and just print these elements?\n",

    "  - And how do we associate these elements with each other so that we can use them in calculations?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Wrap Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the end of the day, whether or not all teams have finished, instructors should make time for sharing and discussion. The following questions might serve as prompts. Alternately, it may be useful to have everyone answer one or two of these in writing (as a self-assessment).\n",

    "## I.  User Stories\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about code as telling a story. A story about the intentions of those who wrote the code: \n",
    " - what they imagined users would do with their code,\n",
    " - and for what purpose,\n",
    " - and who they imagined those users would be.\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, we often make this way of thinking explicit by developing **user stories**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a user story expresses the _who_, _what_, and _why_ in a succinct but concrete way. Written at the outset of a project, user stories provide developers both with guidance as they plan the project, and with benchmarks for measuring the project's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, here are a couple of user stories we could have written about the materials for Python Camp:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a beginning learner of Python (**who**), I want to write code in the context of explanations and examples (**what**), so that I can refer back to the material for review (**why**).\n",
    "2. As an instructor of Python Camp (**who**), I want to give learners self-paced exercises (**what**), so that I can focus on where individual learners get stuck (**why**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, developers create user stories with input from the people who will actually use their software. But even when that's not possible, user stories can offer a helpful framework for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other cases, the only user of your code might be you! But it's still good practice to document your intentions, and writing user stories can help you identify specific aspects or features of the code (developers call these _requirements_) that you need to target in order to meet your needs.\n"

Why? Because a Python dictionary is a data structure that can associate data with certain keys (like course identifiers).\n",
