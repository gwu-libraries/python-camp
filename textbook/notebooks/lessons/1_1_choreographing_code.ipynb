    "\n",
    "- Instructors should model the first Action, introducing the following concepts:\n",
    "  - The function call `print()`, which instruct Python to take an action on the provided argument.\n",
    "  - The result of the function is output to the screen. \n",
    "- Show how to execute a cell of code in the notebook.\n",
    "- Explain that a given cell can be re-executed any number of times.\n",
    "- Model the action by writing the string on a piece of paper and displaying it. (The action is the displaying of it -- analagous to how the print function produces output.)\n",
    "- Divide the remaining actions among the teams. Each team will work with three different activities of increasing complexity. A suggested distribution is as follows:\n",
    "  - A Teams: actions 2a, 3a, 4a \n",
    "  - B Teams: actions 2b, 3b, 4b\n",
    "- If a team finishes early, have them try exercise Action 5: Looping over a List.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask for a volunteer for each action, alternating between A and B teams.\n",
    "- If there is time, work through Action 5 together.\n",
    "- Surface any questions about the code that arise, and highlight the following:\n",
    "  - Numbers and strings behave differently in the same operations (e.g., use of the addition operator).\n",
    "  - Lists and strings have items assigned to numbered positions, starting with 0.\n",
    "  - Loop variables assume the value at each position in sequence.\n"
