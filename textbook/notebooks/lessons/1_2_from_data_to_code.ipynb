    "## Lesson Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain that we will encounter a lot of unfamiliar syntax in this lesson, but that as in the previous lesson, the goal is to see code in action **before** we spend time learning why the code is written as it is (syntax). \n",
    "   - Define **syntax** as the way code is written in a particular language.\n",
    "   - Emphasize that the syntax will be covered in depth in the homework, and that there will be ample time to clarify and solidify understanding over the course of Python Camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduce the idea that we will be working with a single dataset throughout the four days of Python Camp.\n",
    "   - Explain the dataset and its relevance.\n",
    "   - Note that in this exercise, teams will be getting acquainted with the dataset by using some Python commands.\n",
    "   - The data is _represented_ by Python **types**. To start to understand how types work, teams should attend both to the _content_ of the data and how it is _represented_ (the syntax).\n",
    "   - Teams should designate a notetaker to jot down questions and observations that arise in team discussion. \n",
    "   - Remind teams to rotate the notetaker's role.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "Introduce the dataset and JSON format, and ensure everyone can open the JSON file in a notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that the path given is relative to the notebook in the `/textbook/_build/html/_sources/notebooks/lessons` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating lists \n",
    "\n",
    "Have each team work through the `Navigating lists` section. Pause so that groups can share what they notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating nested data / Questions for discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "One goal for this discussion is to highlight how data formats like JSON allow us to *represent relationships*. Our dataset represents a model of something out in the world (textbooks/course materials used by courses at GW), and we're using Python in order to _interact with that model_ in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructors should document the modeling that emerges from this discussion as a tool for use in subsequent team activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask for volunteers (note takers or others) to share the data diagramming done by their teams. The cleaned data has the following hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "bkst_data[list]\n",
    "---a course[dict]\n",
    "------department[str] [...course, section, instructor, etc.]\n",
    "------texts[list]\n",
    "---------a text[dict]\n",
    "------------title[str] [...author, isbn, etc.]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note the presence of the different data types, but emphasize that the homework for Day 1 will cover the differences in detail. For now, focus on how the data elements relate to one another. Language like the following can help:\n",
    "  - A course (in this dataset) _has_ a department, instructor, etc.\n",
    "  - A course _can have_ one or more texts.\n",
    "  - A text has a title, price, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Help teams surface any questions they have about the data or points of confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The second goal of this part of the discussion is to start to identify the syntactic elements of Python that allow us to model the world in certain ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have each team/note taker share their inventory of syntactic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not necessary at this point to go through all of these elements in detail. Depending on the mood of the group, however, it may be useful to highlight the following (as preparation for the homework):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Quotation marks** `''`\n",
    "    - surround strings of characters (letters, numbers, other punctuation)\n",
    "    - occuring on the left side of a colon (e.g., `title`, `isbn`), they function as field names, in Python called **keys**\n",
    "    - occuring on the right side of a colon (e.g., `CHEM`, `Organic Chemistry Model Set`), they function as field **values**\n",
    "    - also used inside square brackets (see below) to retrieve values from their fields:  `text['title']`\n",
    "    - can be single or double: makes no difference to Python\n",
    "  - **Square brackets** `[]`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **list**\n",
    "    - elements of a list can be any other type of Python data, or even multiple types\n",
    "    - also used for accessing data in two ways:\n",
    "      - by position (from a list): `bkst_data[0]`\n",
    "      - by field (from a dictionary): `my_course['department']`\n",
    "  - **Curly braces** `{}`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **dictionary**\n",
    "    - dictionaries have more structure than lists: each element comprises a field name (**key**) associated with a **value**\n",
    "    - square brackets are used to access dictionary values by key (see above)\n",
    "  - **Commas**\n",
    "    - used to separate elements in a dictionary or list\n",
    "  - **Parentheses**\n",
    "    - used when calling **functions**: `print(\"Hello, world!\")`, `len(bkst_data)`\n",
    "    - enclose values or variables passed to the function for processing (**arguments**)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was obtained by scraping the [GW Bookstore](https://www.bkstr.com/georgewashingtonstore/shop/textbooks-and-course-materials) website. Because [web scraping](https://library.gwu.edu/events/web-scraping-what-you-need-know-2023-10-03) is a rather advanced topic, we won't be covering that process in Python Camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was also pre-processed to simplify it somewhat (removing extraneous and redundant elements, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in {term}`JSON` format. JSON (usually pronounced *jay-sawn*) is a common format for sharing data on the web. It's not as concise or human-readable as some formats (e.g., CSV, which is often used for sharing tabular data). But it has a few advantages that make it popular with programmers:\n",
    " - JSON data can be deeply nested, reflecting hierarchical relationships between data elements.\n",
    " - The JSON format comprises structures that map well onto the most common data structures used by modern programming languages. \n",
    " - The JSON syntax has a lot in common with languages like Python.\n",

The file is called `bookstore-data-summer-2023.json`, where the `.json` extension indicates that this is a JSON-formatted file. (The file extension is part of the filename, like `docx` for Word documents or `.xlsx` for Excel spreadsheets.) \n",
    "3. The file is assigned to the temporary variable `f`.\n",
    "4. We use the `json.load` {term}`method` to read the file (`f`). This method is specifically designed for JSON files; it won't work if the file does not contain data in valid JSON format. \n",
