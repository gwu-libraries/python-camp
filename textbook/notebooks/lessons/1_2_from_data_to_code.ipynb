    "## Lesson Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup and goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce the idea that we will be working with a single dataset throughout the four days of Python Camp.\n",
    "   - Explain the dataset and its relevance.\n",
    "   - Note that in this exercise, teams will be getting acquainted with the dataset by using some Python commands.\n",
    "   - The data is _represented_ by Python **types**. To start to understand how types work, teams should attend both to the _content_ of the data and how it is _represented_ (the syntax).\n",
    "   - Teams should designate a notetaker to jot down questions and observations that arise in team discussion. \n",
    "   - Remind teams to rotate the notetaker's role.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain that we will encounter a lot of unfamiliar syntax in this lesson, but that as in the previous lesson, the goal is to see code in action **before** we spend time learning why the code is written as it is (syntax). \n",
    "   - Define **syntax** as the way code is written in a particular language.\n",
    "   - Emphasize that the syntax will be covered in depth in the homework, and that there will be ample time to clarify and solidify understanding over the course of Python Camp.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "Introduce the dataset and JSON format, and ensure everyone can open the JSON file in a notebook.\n",
    "    \n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating lists \n",
    "\n",
    "Have each team work through the `Navigating lists` section. Pause so that groups can share what they notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigating nested data / Questions for discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "One goal for this discussion is to highlight how data formats like JSON allow us to *represent relationships*. Our dataset represents a model of something out in the world (textbooks/course materials used by courses at GW), and we're using Python in order to _interact with that model_ in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructors should document the modeling that emerges from this discussion as a tool for use in subsequent team activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask for volunteers (note takers or others) to share the data diagramming done by their teams. The cleaned data has the following hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "bkst_data[list]\n",
    "---a course[dict]\n",
    "------department[str] [...course, section, instructor, etc.]\n",
    "------texts[list]\n",
    "---------a text[dict]\n",
    "------------title[str] [...author, isbn, etc.]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Note the presence of the different data types, but emphasize that the homework for Day 1 will cover the differences in detail. For now, focus on how the data elements relate to one another. Language like the following can help:\n",
    "  - A course (in this dataset) _has_ a department, instructor, etc.\n",
    "  - A course _can have_ one or more texts.\n",
    "  - A text has a title, price, etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Help teams surface any questions they have about the data or points of confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The second goal of this part of the discussion is to start to identify the syntactic elements of Python that allow us to model the world in certain ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have each team/note taker share their inventory of syntactic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not necessary at this point to go through all of these elements in detail. Depending on the mood of the group, however, it may be useful to highlight the following (as preparation for the homework):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Quotation marks** `''`\n",
    "    - surround strings of characters (letters, numbers, other punctuation)\n",
    "    - occuring on the left side of a colon (e.g., `title`, `isbn`), they function as field names, in Python called **keys**\n",
    "    - occuring on the right side of a colon (e.g., `CHEM`, `Organic Chemistry Model Set`), they function as field **values**\n",
    "    - also used inside square brackets (see below) to retrieve values from their fields:  `text['title']`\n",
    "    - can be single or double: makes no difference to Python\n",
    "  - **Square brackets** `[]`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **list**\n",
    "    - elements of a list can be any other type of Python data, or even multiple types\n",
    "    - also used for accessing data in two ways:\n",
    "      - by position (from a list): `bkst_data[0]`\n",
    "      - by field (from a dictionary): `my_course['department']`\n",
    "  - **Curly braces** `{}`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **dictionary**\n",
    "    - dictionaries have more structure than lists: each element comprises a field name (**key**) associated with a **value**\n",
    "    - square brackets are used to access dictionary values by key (see above)\n",
    "  - **Commas**\n",
    "    - used to separate elements in a dictionary or list\n",
    "  - **Parentheses**\n",
    "    - used when calling **functions**: `print(\"Hello, world!\")`, `len(bkst_data)`\n",
    "    - enclose values or variables passed to the function for processing (**arguments**)\n",

    "\n",
    "The following notebook has cells containing Python code for interacting with an external data file. \n",

    "1. Before you begin, each team should assign the following roles:\n",
    "     - Notetaker (records the outcome of team discussions)\n",
    "     - Reporter (speaks for the team when sharing out)\n",
    "     - Advocate (makes sure everyone has a chance to contribute)\n",
    "2. Read the section below, [Getting to Know Your Data](#i-getting-to-know-your-data), and as a team, do the exercises marked `Try it out!`\n",
    "3. After we pause for sharing out from the teams, you'll work through the code in the notebook as a team.\n",
    "   - Run each cell of code in this notebook (by pressing `Control` + `Enter` on a PC,  `Command` + `Return` on a Mac). The output of running the code will appear below the cell.\n",
    "   - Each cell is accompanied by annotations, and in some cases, questions for discussion. Discuss your responses to these questions with your team. The note taker should brielfy document the conversation (including any further questions or points of confusion that arise).\n",
    "   - Blank cells labeled `Try it out!` invite you to write your own code based on the provided examples. Run your code and discuss the output with your team.\n",
    "4. Once everyone has worked through the notebook, we'll review the questions and your responses in the larger group.\n"

It's not as concise or human-readable as some formats (e.g., CSV, which is often used for sharing tabular data). But it has a few advantages that make it popular with programmers:\n",
    " - JSON data can be deeply nested, reflecting hierarchical relationships between data elements.\n",

Here's a rule of thumb that can help: when working with nested data, always try to keep track of the level at which you're working. Variables can be useful for this purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For instance, in the code above, the variable `bkst_data` holds a list of courses. \n",
    "2. We point to a single course (the second) using the variable `my_course`. If we wanted to point to a different course, we could simply reassign the variable, e.g., `my_course = bkst_data[100]`. After running that bit of code, `my_course` would point to the 101st course in the list.\n",
    "3. The `my_books` variable points to the list of textbooks associated with the course in `my_course` (either the second course or whatever other course we assigned to it). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you find visual analogies useful, think of our dataset as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a file cabinet, where each course corresponds to a separate drawer, and within each drawer, there is a folder containing sheets of paper about textbooks. (The folder may be empty.) \n",
    "- As a series of nesting dolls, or boxes inside boxes. \n",
    "- Or if you're a Marvel fan, as the multiverse, wherein each universe may or may not have its own version of your favorite superheroes.\n",

These are helpful hints for the programmer, but they mean nothing to Python. We could name our variables `spiderman` and `doctor_strange`, if we wanted to, and they would work just as well (though _we_ might be more prone to make mistakes!).\n",
