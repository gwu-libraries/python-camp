    "- If you want to review a particular concept in order to solidify your understanding.\n",
    "- If you want to build more \"muscle memory\" by writing code beyond the opportunities provided by the group activities and homework.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Optional annotations (labeled `For the curious...`) provide additional explanation and/or context for those who want them. Feel free to skip these sections if you like. As a beginner, it's important to maintain a balanced cognitive load: taking in too much information all at once can impede your progress toward understanding. This balance looks different for everyone, but we have tried to keep the main content focused on a few key concepts, tools, and techniques, while providing that additional context for those who might benefit from it.\n",

Note that in context of strings, the `+` does not do numeric addition, it does concatenation. In other words,  `1 + 2` produces `3` (addition), but `\"1\" + \"2\"` produces `\"12\"` (concatenation), because the quotation marks around the digits in the second example tell Python to treat them as strings, not numbers.\n",

To remedy the error, we need to make sure that the values on both sides of the plus sign are strings. We can use the built-in `str()` function to convert the integer result of `len()` to a string. While we're at it, we also concatenate a single space (between quotation marks) as required in the instructions:\n",

    "- `len(seq2) / 10` returns `22.0`, which is a whole number but given its one-place decimal representation because division in Python (the `/` operator) is defined always to return a value of type {term}`float`. It returns a float even in cases where the result _could be_ represented as an integer (as in this case). Python behaves this way in order to provide consistency: as a programmer, you can rely on the division operator always to return the same data type. Generally speaking, integers and floats in Python are interoperable, meaning that you can mix both freely in most types of calculation. \n",

    "Since the three elements in the `address_info` strings are separated by commas, we can use the `str.split()` method with its optional first argument, `sep`. Note that the Python [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) tells us the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If `sep` is not specified or is `None`, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we write `address_info1.split()` with nothing between parentheses, the `sep` argument will be `None` by default, which means that the string will be split on {term}`white space`, with any number of consecutive spaces being treated as a single instance (a single separator). That's the default behavior, but we can modify this by providing a single argument to `split` for the separator, either with or without the argument name:\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "work equally well, giving the {term}`list` `[\"SF\", \"R\", \"1986\"]` as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same approach works also for `address_info2` and `address_info3`. In each case, we can access the individual elements by {term}`index`ing into the list returned by `split`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "result1 = address_info1.split(\",\")\n",
    "property_type1 = result1[0]\n",
    "rent_or_owned1 = result1[1]\n",
    "year_built1 = result1[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Assuming that the strings with this information always have _two and only two_ commas, the `split` method will always return a three-element list. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could take the same approach with the `address1` string (`\"AGF5670 2123 N. 3rd St., St. Cloud, MN 56301\"`), splitting this time on the whitespace (the default):\n",
    "```\n",
    "address_parts1 = address1.split()\n",

    "Assuming the strings in Alia's datafile are consistently formed, we could extract the identifer, state abbreviation, and zip code as follows:\n",

    "state_abbreviation1 = address_parts1[-2]\n",
    "zip_code1 = address_parts1[-1]\n",

    "Extracting the street adddress and city proves more difficult, however. In our example, each part of the street address (`\"2123 N. 3rd St.,\"`) is separated by white space, as are the two parts of the city name (`\"St. Cloud,\"`). This situation poses two problems for using the `str.split()` method:\n",
    "  - It's not going to be terribly useful -- at least, not for Alia's purposes -- to treat the parts of the street address or city name as different elements. For instance, the \"N.\" and the \"St.\" in \"N. 3rd St.\" don't really mean anything on their own, and the same goes for \"St.\" and \"Cloud\" in \"St. Cloud.\" \n",
    "  - Different addresses and cities will involve different amounts of white space. Consider \"3150 Elm St.\" or \"Roanoke.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To to extract the address/city name element from our original address string using split, we could take the following approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the originl string on white space, producing a list.\n",
    "```\n",
    "address_parts1 = address1.split()\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Take a slice _of the resulting list_ (not the original string) in order to get the elements between the first (the identifier) and the second-to-last (the state abbreviation).\n",
    "```\n",
    "street_address1 = address_parts1[1:-2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Note that `street_address1` is also a list. (Slicing a string returns a string; slicing a list returns a list.) We can use this list with the `str.join` method, which takes as its argument a list and returns a string that consists of each element in the list separated by whatever string the method is called on. The following code creates a new string out of the street address/city name elements by gluing them together (so to speak) with white space:\n",
    "```\n",
    "street_and_city1 = \" \".join(street_address1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, splitting isn't necessarily a better approach to Alia's first problem than slicing. But the larger point is that there are almost always more ways than one of solving a problem with Python. In this case, which approach you choose might come down to your preferences as a programmer. \n",
