    "- If you want to review a particular concept in order to solidify your understanding.\n",
    "- If you want to build more \"muscle memory\" by writing code beyond the opportunities provided by the group activities and homework.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Optional annotations (labeled `For the curious...`) provide additional explanation and/or context for those who want them. Feel free to skip these sections if you like. As a beginner, it's important to maintain a balanced cognitive load: taking in too much information all at once can impede your progress toward understanding. This balance looks different for everyone, but we have tried to keep the main content focused on a few key concepts, tools, and techniques, while providing that additional context for those who might benefit from it.\n",

Note that in the context of strings, the `+` does not do numeric addition, it does concatenation. In other words,  `1 + 2` produces `3` (addition), but `\"1\" + \"2\"` produces `\"12\"` (concatenation), because the quotation marks around the digits in the second example tell Python to treat them as strings, not numbers.\n",

To remedy the error, we need to make sure that the values on both sides of the plus sign are strings. We can use the built-in `str()` function to convert the integer result of `len()` to a string. While we're at it, we also concatenate a single space (between quotation marks) as required in the instructions:\n",

    "- `len(seq2) / 10` returns `22.0`, which is mathematically a whole number, but here it is given a one-place decimal representation because division in Python (the `/` operator) is defined always to return a value of type {term}`float`. Division returns a float even in cases where the result _could be_ represented as an integer (as in this case). Python behaves this way in order to provide consistency: as a programmer, you can rely on the division operator always to return the same data type. Generally speaking, integers and floats in Python are interoperable, meaning that you can mix both freely in most types of calculation. \n",

That's the default behavior, but we can modify this by providing a single argument to `split` for the separator, either with or without the argument name:\n",

This situation poses two problems for using the `str.split()` method:\n",

    "```\n",
    "3. Note that `street_address1` is also a list. (Slicing a string returns a string; slicing a list returns a list.) We can use this list with the `str.join` method, which takes as its argument a list and returns a string that consists of each element in the list separated by whatever string the method is called on. The following code creates a new string out of the street address/city name elements by gluing them together (so to speak) with white space:\n",

    "\n",
    "With lists we access individual elements by providing the index (as an integer) between square brackets (`[]`). Access to dictionary elements follows a similar pattern, except that the element between brackets is the dictionary key (usually, but not always, a string). \n",
    "\n",
    "To access the values for the `\"degree\"`, `\"languages\"` and `\"q1\"` keys, we can write the following. Note the use of quotation marks around the keys inside brackets: that is important, because the keys are strings.\n",
    "```\n",
    "degree1 = r1_dict[\"degree\"]\n",
    "languages1 = r1_dict[\"languages\"]\n",
    "q1_1 = r1_dict[\"q1\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Updating values by keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating works the same as access. Note that if we want to update the value associated with a key, we put the expression with the key on **the left side** of the equals sign.\n",
    "```\n",
    "l = r1_dict[\"languages\"].split(\",\")\n",
    "r1_dict[\"languages\"] = l\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, the first line retrieves the value of the `\"languages\"` key, splits the string on the commas, and then assigns the result to the temporary variable `l`. We could also write this code in one line, as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "r1_dict[\"languages\"] = r1_dict[\"languages\"].split(\",\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Conceptually, this code is similar to the code for reassigning a variable, e.g. `n = n + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding new keys and values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a new key & value uses the same syntax as updating the value of an existing key. Because dictionaries do not have a syntax analogous to slicing a list, in order to calculate the average of the respondent's survey scores, we have to access each value separately:\n",
    "```\n",
    "average1 = (r1_dict[\"q1\"] + r1_dict[\"q2\"] + r1_dict[\"q3\"] + r1_dict[\"q4\"] + r1_dict[\"q5\"]) / 5\n",
    "r1_dict[\"average_score\"] = average1\n",
