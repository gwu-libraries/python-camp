    "\n",
    "5. Optional annotations (labeled `For the curious...`) provide additional explanation and/or context for those who want them. Feel free to skip these sections if you like. As a beginner, it's important to maintain a balanced cognitive load: taking in too much information all at once can impede your progress toward understanding. This balance looks different for everyone, but we have tried to keep the main content focused on a few key concepts, tools, and techniques, while providing that additional context for those who might benefit from it.\n",

Note that in the context of strings, the `+` does not do numeric addition, it does concatenation. In other words,  `1 + 2` produces `3` (addition), but `\"1\" + \"2\"` produces `\"12\"` (concatenation), because the quotation marks around the digits in the second example tell Python to treat them as strings, not numbers.\n",

    "- `len(seq2) / 10` returns `22.0`, which is mathematically a whole number, but here it is given a one-place decimal representation because division in Python (the `/` operator) is defined always to return a value of type {term}`float`. Division returns a float even in cases where the result _could be_ represented as an integer (as in this case). Python behaves this way in order to provide consistency: as a programmer, you can rely on the division operator always to return the same data type. Generally speaking, integers and floats in Python are interoperable, meaning that you can mix both freely in most types of calculation. \n",

    "To add the number of languages to the data for each respondent, we also need to use a loop. The logical plan for this task is a bit more straightforward: for each response, (1) we need to access the value stored under the `\"languages\"` key, which we expect to be a Python string; (2) then we need to split that string on the commas, (3) take the length of the resulting list, (4) and store the result under a `\"num_languages\"` key in that response dictionary:\n",

    "The code provided does steps 2, 3, and 4 in the same line, but you could also code those as separate lines. The crucial parts are that we're retrieving the value from the `\"languages\"` key (`resp[\"languages\"]` is on the right side of an equals sign), doing something to that value, and saving the result under the `\"num_languages\"` key (`resp[\"num_languages\"]` is on the left side of an equals sign). \n",
    "\n",
    "And don't forget the quotation marks around `\"languages\"` and `\"num_languages\"` when using them as dictionary keys -- the dictionary keys are strings, and here we're providing their literal string values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bonus**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce repetition when finding the average scores, we can use a dictionary to store the running totals instead of separate variables.\n",
    "For instance, we could define a `total_scores` dictionary, with a key for each question, and we could initialize them all to 0:\n",
    "```\n",
    "total_scores = {\"q1\": 0, \n",
    "                \"q2\": 0,\n",

    "                \"q5\": 0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, inside the for loop that gives us each response, to avoid having to type `total_scores[\"q1\"]`, `total_scores[\"q2\"]`, etc., we can take advantage of the fact that looping over a _dictionary_ in Python returns the dictionary keys. Then the rest of logical plan would look like this:\n",
    "1. Loop over the list of response.\n",
    "2. For each response, _loop over the keys_ in the `total_scores` dictionary. (We do this _inside_ the first loop.)\n",
    "3. For each key from `total_scores`, increment its value in `total_scores` with the value of the same key in the current response dictionary.\n",
    "4. To find the averages, loop over the `total_scores` dictionary again (after the loop over the responses is done), dividing the value for each key by the length of `responses`.\n",

    "```\n",
    "for resp in responses:\n",
    "    for q in total_scores:\n",

    "for q in total_scores:\n",
    "    total_scores[q] = total_scores[q] / len(responses)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that this code is less repetitive than our previous version, but it's also potentially harder to understand. In using this code, it's important to keep in mind that the loop variable `resp` and the loop variable `q` refer to very different things:\n",
    " - `resp` will hold each of the dictionaries in the list `responses`\n",
    " - `q` will hold each of the keys, which are strings in `total_scores`: so `\"q1\"`, `\"q2\"`, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "    coded_responses.append(coded_resp)           #6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since we want the data structure for the coded responses to have the same structure as the original `responses` list, we define a new, empty dictionary to hold each coded response. (We technically could reuse the dictionary from `responses` -- which is held by the loop variable `resp` -- but this approach keeps things cleaner, and it preserves our original data as is, should we need it later.\n",
    "2. We need to copy the value of the `\"id\"` key over to the new dictionary.\n",
    "3. Here we're testing our conditions against the list held by the `\"languages\"` key in each dictionary from `responses`. The order of our if statements in this case does matter, because the _first_ condition to evaluate to `True` will be executed. According to Priya's specifications, if the response includes more than one language, _regardless of language_, it should be coded as a 3. In other words, a response with a value for `lang_list` of `[\"Python\", \"R\"]` would receive a 3, not a 2. In order to implement this logic in Python, we need to test for this condition first.\n",
    "4. This condition is evaluated only if `lang_list` has fewer than 2 elements. Note the use of the `or` keyword to check for both conditions. Note also that we _cannot_ write `elif \"Python\" or \"R\" in lang_list`. (Technically, we _can_ write that, but it won't have the desired effect: `elif \"Python\" ...` will _always_ evaluate to `True`, no matter what comes after, because a non-empty string is always coerced to `True` by an if statement. The correct, though unfortunately verbose, way to code this statement is to repeat the `in lang_list` expression for each string we're testing.\n",
    "5. Because `lang_code` is assigned _something_ in every branch of the `if-elif-else` statement, we can assume that it will have the correct value at this point. And be careful about indentation -- if this line were indented under the `else:` line, it would get executed only for cases where `lang_code` is `1` -- not at all what we want!\n",
    "6. It's easy to forget to append our dictionary to the new list. But if we omit this step, `code_resp` will get a new dictionary on every iteration of the loop, and each dictionary will overwrite the last.\n",
