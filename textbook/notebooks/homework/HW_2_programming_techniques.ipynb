    "\n",
    "Given all that you have learned so far, you could go on to solve many, many more problems using Python. In other words, we've covered the bare essentials; it's one of the main advantages of Python (as a programming language) that these essentials can be covered in just a couple of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the Python language offers many other tools and techniques to make code more robust, reusable, and efficient. One way to think about these tools and techniques is that they help us write _programs_ as opposed to writing code, a **program** being some code that is designed for use by different users in different contexts. Even if you are the only user of your code, applying these programming techniques can make your work more productive and your code more effective.\n",

    "\n",
    "Errors can be jarring. For many of us, error messages on the computer inspire frustration, even anger. They may even make us feel misunderstood, or else that we lack understanding, that we just don't \"get\" it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to program (in virtually any language) involves learning how to deal with errors. There's no such thing as a piece of software without \"bugs,\" if only because for any given piece of software, someone can find a way to use it for which it was not intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we didn't design the function specifically to work for strings with commas, and indeed, it doesn't. The `ValueError` -- technically, this kind of error is called an **exception** -- means simply that the Python interpreter encountered a kind of value it didn't expect and doesn't know what to do with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such errors/exceptions are valuable (no pun intended) to the programmer; they tell us where the bugs are (or might be) in our programs. Python even provides mechanisms for checking for errors proactively, so that our code doesn't grind to a halt whenever it encounters one.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Days 3 and 4, we'll work more with errors and exceptions, and we'll learn about an approach to writing code that uses errors to guide development."

    "What's the difference between an **error** and an **exception**? \n",
    "\n",
    "Technically, even though they often have the word `Error` in their name, most of the errors you'll encounter when programming in Python are called _exceptions_. These describe situations where a line of code may or may not work, depending on other factors. These other factors include the rest of the code in the program, the input to the program, the environment in which the program is being run, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The example above is an exception because the line `return float(amt)` works _except_ when `amt` is a string that contains something besides numerals and a period. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different from exceptions are **syntax errors**. A syntax error means that the line of code will never work because Python cannot parse it (i.e., interpret it correctly). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following line of code will produce a syntax error because I failed to close the quotation marks around the string argument to `print()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('Hello, cruel world!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But in practice, this distinction doesn't matter very much, so feel free to refer to both exceptions and syntax errors as errors!\n",
