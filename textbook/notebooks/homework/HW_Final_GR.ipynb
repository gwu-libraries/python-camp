Instead, it offers you an opportunity to put into practice what you've learned throughout Python Camp. The exercises build toward a more complex solution, but we have tried to make each step explicit, so as to give you occasion to reflect on many of the concepts you have learned and how they fit together. \n",

You're welcome to use any and all sources of information to complete these exercises. You're also encouraged to ask your Python-Camp colleagues and facilitators for help! \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Run the first code cell under the exercise heading**. This will execute some code needed to set up the problem.\n",
    "2. Reading the instructions and write code in the empty code cell (labeled with the comment `Your code here`). Run this code.\n",
    "3. Your code cell should include the comment line `#Your code below`. **Please do not delete this comment**, and if you accidentally delete the cell and have to recreate it, please insert that comment line at the top of the cell before entering your code.\n",
    "4. Assuming your code does not produce any errors, run the code in the cell below the `Tests` heading. Each line of this code consists of a Python {term}`assert statement`. \n",
    "   - If you see an `AssertionError`, don't panic! The error is written so as to help you pinpoint the part of your code that's not working as expected. After making a change in your code, re-run **both** the cell with your code and the cell with the tests. Repeat until you see no errors.\n",
    "   - If you run the cell with the test code and you see no output, congratulations! That means that your code has passed all the tests and works as expected. Go to step 5 to submit.\n",
    "5. Submit your code by downloading this notebook from JupyterHub and uploading it to the GitHub repository for this assignment. See [the documentation](https://gwu-libraries.github.io/python-camp/homework.html) for detailed instructions."
