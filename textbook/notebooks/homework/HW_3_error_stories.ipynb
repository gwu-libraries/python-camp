    "To err is human. And since writing code is a human activity, it's no less error-prone than anything else. Just as human stories tend to dramatize the protagonists' mishaps, misteps, and mistakes en route to their triumphs and successes, the stories we tell in code necessarily traffic in errors. \n",
