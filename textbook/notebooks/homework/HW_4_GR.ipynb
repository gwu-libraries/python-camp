    "3. Assuming your code does not produce any errors, run the code in the cell below the `Tests` heading. Each line of this code consists of a Python {term}`assert statement`. \n",
    "   - If you see an `AssertionError`, don't panic! The error is written so as to help you pinpoint the part of your code that's not working as expected. After making a change in your code, re-run **both** the cell with your code and the cell with the tests. Repeat until you see no errors.\n",
    "   - If you run the cell with the test code and you see no output, congratulations! That means that your code has passed all the tests and works as expected. Go to step 4 to submit.\n",
